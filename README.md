# About
This project is an Android app developed by me in my Master's (2014) for a biomedical electronic dynamometer with Bluetooth interface. 
I decided to make it open-source since I have the option.

# Research Results
Using the implemented dynamometer and the app, for the first time, the force exerted by the hand's lumbrical muscles were measured. 
I also checked that the analysis of the grip strength was better and more easily achieved with the app.

# Building the app
The development was done in Eclipse ADT starting late-2012 until mid-2014. Unfortunately Eclipse ADT was [discontinued](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2015/06/an-update-on-eclipse-android-developer.html)
in 2015, so I updated the app to be functional with Android Studio and Gradle.

Therefore, just clone or download and open it as a project in Android Studio. 


# Additional Information
The entire project was done at Sao Paulo State University's LIEB (Instrumentation and Biomedical Engineering Laboratory) under Professor Dr. Aparecido Augusto de Carvalho supervision.
